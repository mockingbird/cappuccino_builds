Cappuccino Bootstrap Base
=========================

Introduction
------------
Cappuccino is an open source framework that makes it easy to build
desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.

This repository is not Cappuccino itself. You can find Cappuccino here:

http://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino

So if this is not Cappuccino, what is it?
-----------------------------------------

This repository is used by the Cappuccino core developers to distribute the
release versions of Cappuccino. It contains prebuilt versions of Cappuccino
which can be used either as they are to begin developing with Cappuccino,
or as a foundation to build your own versions of Cappuccino from the main
repository.

Each version tagged branch contains the corresponding release build of
Cappuccino, plus the various build tools and supporting packages necessary
to build Cappuccino.
